# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
  ["income", "fixed_income", "expense", "fixed_expense"].each do |category|
    Category.find_or_create_by!(name: category, category_type: 0)
  end
